# Hate-Speech-Classification-tacking-misogyny-and-xenophobia-
Hate speech is defined as any statement that disparages a person or a group based on a trait such
as race, color, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, or other qualities. Given
the vast amount of user-generated content on the Internet, particularly on social media, the
problem of recognizing, and thus potentially countering, Hate Speech spread is becoming
increasingly important, for example in the fight against misogyny and xenophobia. Twitter's job
is to facilitate public debate, which necessitates the representation of a diverse range of
viewpoints. Yet, it does not advance viciousness against or straightforwardly assault or
undermine others based on race, nationality, public cause, rank, sexual direction, age, inability, or
genuine illness. Hate speech can be harmful to an individual or a community. Now, due to the
increase in social media usage, hate speech is very commonly used on these platforms. So, it is
not possible to identify hate speeches manually. So, we develop an automated hate speech
detection model targeted towards women and immigrants in the wake of situations throughout
the world. We use various text pre-processing methods, text embeddings, and feature extraction
using TF-IDF, CBOW, and GloVE and perform 3 binary classification tasks using Random
Forest and Support Vector Machine algorithms. We detect the presence of hate speech, and if itâ€™s
found to be present we further classify them into targeted vs non-targeted and aggressive vs
non-aggressive
